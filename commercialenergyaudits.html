						<p>Cascade Building Solutions first ensures that all commercial building energy audits adhere to ASHRAE standard 211. ASHRAE is the leading organization in building sciences and following their standards ensures our clients are receiving the highest quality reports. We begin with a review of all construction, commissioning, and utility bill documents. Before even stepping foot on site, we will be experts on the design and operation of your building. We create detailed plans for taking onsite measurements, inspecting equipment, surveying tenants, and reviewing controls. This ensures minimal time spent utilizing facilities and maintenance staff during the audit. The goals of the building owners are always the number one priority and audits can be adjusted to fit any needs. </p>

						<p>Starting at an ASHRAE level 2 audit, Cascade includes building energy modeling as a standard. Utilizing the top industry standard, IES Virtual Environment building modeling software, Cascade will perform a more detailed analysis than most competitors on the market. The building modeling analysis includes solar shading strategies, HVAC configuration and replacement options, controls strategies, solar panel feasibility, after hours setback analysis, and so much more. The methods used during this process are the same used by the nation’s top engineering firms when designing buildings and assessing life cycle costs. </p>

						<p>Cascade’s on site audits include a wide variety of measurements to guarantee all building recommendations are based on sound science. Infrared analysis of the building envelope and equipment identifies opportunities for repairs that can minimize cost and extend the life of assets. Runtime, temperature, humidity, and a variety of other monitors can shed light on the mysteries of building operations where owners do not have permanent sensors in place. Level 2 audits also include carbon dioxide measurements to ensure HVAC systems are turning over fresh air as designed. These audits don’t only help save energy, they provide a means for buildings to operate like they should and for tenants to achieve maximum comfort.</p>
